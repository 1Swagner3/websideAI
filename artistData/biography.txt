[SicHat - The Beginning]
Starting in 2019, SicHat began as a side project. The founder, primarily a drummer for several bands, used this project as an avenue to release songs that did not align with his band's style but appealed to him personally. It was a domain of uncompromised musical exploration, distinct from the founder's band endeavors, which were dissolving at their initial stage.

[Autotune - A Stylistic Choice]
A noticeable element in SicHat's music is the unapologetic use of autotune. Initially a tool to complement an untrained voice, it became a deliberate stylistic choice, contributing to the cyber, post-apocalyptic aesthetic and the conceptual fusion of humanity and technology in SicHat's music. The robotic voice resonates with the themes and visuals of SicHat's art, symbolizing a synthesis of human and machine. The debate around the authenticity of autotune in music is paralleled with discussions on the capability of robots to experience genuine emotions.

[Autotune - Public Reception]
The public reception of autotune is mixed. Some listeners feel deceived by the leveling of the musical field it brings, questioning the effort and authenticity in the musical pieces using it. This pushback is likened to the initial rejection of distorted guitars and electronic drums. It represents a phase of adaptation before embracing new musical styles and dimensions, and SicHat eagerly pioneers in exploring these new territories.

[Artistic Ambition]
SicHat represents the journey of a self-taught artist striving to match his grand visions with the reality of limited resources. The endeavor involves acquiring skills in graphic design, video editing, and audio engineering, aiming to produce commercially competitive music independently. The artistic ambition is symbolized by the logo and is driven by a commitment to constant improvement, evolving one step at a time.
