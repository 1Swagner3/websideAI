Baby just hold me only for a moment. Feeling so cold, wanna feel your warmth until tears falling. Set my heart on fire (Fire, fire). I play it strong, don’t get close to my feelings. Try to stabilize what is left of my being. Always obliged to keep up a smile. It doesn’t get easier the longer you lie. I keep it on, put my heart in the freezer. Life is getting tough if you are a people pleaser. Everyone is busy fighting their own fight. May I ask if you have free time tonight? I can’t keep this up, fighting solo until I collapse. My bag gets heavier every day. Wish you'd rescue me. So hold me tight, be my resting place. Let go of my weaknesses; no regrets. Confine me in your bed until we're strangers at sunrise. Loving yourself is hard. I’d prefer a refund and a fresh start. Never cared for glitz and glam; I'd rather you call me your man. Planned my life till 2012. Now, a decade later, I mostly loathe myself. I hate to admit wanting you daily. Your touch, your smile, what I miss nightly. Could be a ghost for all I know, but that's unholy.
