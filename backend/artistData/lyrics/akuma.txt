Akuma. Why, why won’t you die? In pact with the devil, I doubt that he will let me go. Knock knock surprise, SicHat is back with another banger track. Don't let me hear you say it's bad, you can’t even reach or comprehend me. Did you really think it's easy to make me quit? Every time you have a reason, I find another, fighting through it. Now where the game is on, endurance makes me strong. If you think you know what it takes, never cross me, you're messing with the wrong one. I'll never admit defeat or quit; aiming for the top list. In pact with the devil, I can't eat, I can’t sleep. Every night I hear him breathe until I make it happen. Lost my smile, can't cry, life feels like a lie. Here I make my stand, fear shaking my hand. If you see me kneel, remember the feel. Looking for a life with purpose, won't let others wear me down. All my sacrifices are like compromises, paying with blood, facing my own demises. Now where the game is on, I'll carry on until done. No tear, no dreams undone. Devil, he will never let me go. Can I make it happen?
