Watashi wa anata o ikita mama tabemasu. Go ahead call me delirious, what do I care you are oblivious. Bitch I’m a monster, I’m serious. I’ll eat you alive, I’m furious. All your advice, injurious. How you survive, I’m curious. And be victorious. Had enough betrayal, rising straight from hell. Angels strike the bell, a monster's coming, they can tell. Ready to tell the story; hard work leads to glory. Eternal purgatory in heaven's territory. Never cared about cash, only wanted revenge. Burn your existence to ash, feed wolves your rotten flesh. Feel eyes on my back, watch me close, I bet. Won't give you a second chance. And now, every step forward leads to pain, then flames, then rain. Born like Hiruko, no talent, no future, stitched life, but you're unaware. Keep circles close, knowing when money flows, foes grow. When your dream's over, I’ll be atop the tower. One question: how's it feel to be powerless?
