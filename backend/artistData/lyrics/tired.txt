I’m so tired of you because this world is not about you. Now you say let’s get serious at my place. I play it cool because I know you like when I do. One week, you called because I haven’t answered my phone. Oh here we go again, trying not to fail again. This ain’t the first, we’ve tried way too long, made a mess, never made it out. It may be like, feel like there never was a lot to find. Just make it quick, I won’t stand for it. Now you say we never gave it a try, but hey, it’s cruel, these are crossing my mind. Next time I’ll try, really doing my best not to fall for love that is already gone. And I just don’t know what I have to do with you, why I’m such a fool, why we try so hard for feelings. Just make me quit, I won’t stand for it.
