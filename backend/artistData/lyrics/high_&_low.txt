High & Low, SicHat:
Loved by fortune; work really hard; live in shadows, forgotten past. Hands devoured by hatred, shaking unrest; feel the world before you pierce my chest. Eyes seen chaos; you wouldn't last; weapons I wield, shadows I feel, more than test. Left friends said can't; slept park zero cash; worked hard/fast, dreams. Moved on, strong; failed times; hid pride, coffin nailed. Heart wired cables won't last; another day, ignoring stress. Soul bound demon; day in my skin is a lot. Doubt I can't forget; crowd vision loud; breakout, talent crown worth. Hands chasing strands; no dance; thanks fans. I'll never be enough, can't pass through, high and low. Taking time, don't mind; grind for a find, life on line. Darkness unique; closing eyes, letting go; choose day. Grounded, head clouds; seek pride, heart fear, exit. Born hardship, work up, heart and gut; use all before break.
Ref: Never find someone for high/low; can't take on high/low; no one for high/low.
